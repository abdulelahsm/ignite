  ```python 
  # Issue in loading .pt file
  def fetch_last_checkpoint_model_filename(model_save_path):

    import os
    checkpoint_files = os.listdir(model_save_path)
    checkpoint_files = [f for f in checkpoint_files if '.pth' in f]
    checkpoint_iter = [int(x.split('_')[2].split('.')[0]) for x in checkpoint_files]
    last_idx = np.array(checkpoint_iter).argmax()
    return os.path.join(model_save_path, checkpoint_files[last_idx])

  model.load_state_dict(torch.load(fetch_last_checkpoint_model_filename('./saved_models')))
  print("Model Loaded")
  ```

  Changed to 

  ```python
  # loading the saved model
  def fetch_last_checkpoint_model_filename(model_save_path):

    import os
    checkpoint_files = os.listdir(model_save_path)
    checkpoint_files = [f for f in checkpoint_files if '.pt' in f]
    checkpoint_iter = [int(x.split('_')[2].split('.')[0]) for x in checkpoint_files]
    last_idx = np.array(checkpoint_iter).argmax()
    return os.path.join(model_save_path, checkpoint_files[last_idx])

  model.load_state_dict(torch.load(fetch_last_checkpoint_model_filename('./saved_models')))
  print("Model Loaded")

- FastaiLRFinder_MNIST.ipynb

  Added a couple of lines to the notebook to install ignite.
  Use PyTorch-Ignite 0.4.2

- EfficientNet_Cifar100_finetuning.ipynb

  Deprecation warnings after running ```!sh setup.sh``` , ```d = torch.linspace(-10.0, 10.0)```, ```graph_def = graph(model, x, operator_export_type='RAW')```

- Cifar10_Ax_hyperparam_tuning.ipynb

  ```ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ax'```  when running init_notebook_plotting() at the hyperparam tuning setup section of the notebook

  ```NameError: name 'optimize' is not defined``` when running the cell that starts after (start tuning section)

- Cifar100_bench_amp.ipynb

  ```ERROR: torchvision 0.9.0.dev20201120+cu101 has requirement torch==1.8.0.dev20201120+cu101, but you'll have torch 1.6.0.dev20200411+cu101 which is incompatible.``` when running the installation cells

- MNIST_on_TPU.ipynb

  Tensorboard error ```No dashboards are active for the current data set.```
  Refactor text cells
  Use PyTorch-Ignite 0.4.2
  
- HandlersTimeProfiler_MNIST.ipynb

  Tensorboard error ```403. Thatâ€™s an error.```
